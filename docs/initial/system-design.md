### System Design and Configuration for Asynchronous Upload, Download, and Streaming

As an expert in Solution Architecture and Data Engineering, I will outline a robust, scalable system design for a storage management system akin to Google Drive or OneDrive. The design emphasizes asynchronous processing to ensure high availability, responsiveness, and fault tolerance. Key components include microservices architecture, cloud-native services (e.g., AWS equivalents for generality), and integration patterns for logging, error handling, and caching. This configuration assumes a distributed system with load balancing, auto-scaling, and containerization (e.g., via Kubernetes).

#### Core Architecture Overview
- **Frontend/API Layer**: A RESTful API (e.g., built with Node.js/Express or Spring Boot) handles client requests. It uses JWT for authentication and authorization.
- **Backend Workers**: Asynchronous tasks are offloaded to worker nodes (e.g., via Celery for Python or BullMQ for Node.js) that process queues.
- **Storage Layer**: Object storage like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage for file blobs, with metadata stored in a relational database (detailed below).
- **Queueing System**: Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for message queuing to decouple synchronous API calls from resource-intensive operations.
- **Streaming/CDN Layer**: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) like CloudFront or Akamai for efficient delivery.

#### Asynchronous Upload Configuration
- **Process Flow**:
  1. Client initiates upload via API endpoint (e.g., multipart/form-data for large files).
  2. API validates request (e.g., file size limits, user quotas) and generates a pre-signed URL for direct upload to object storage if possible (for efficiency). For complex uploads (e.g., resumable), the API chunks the file and enqueues jobs.
  3. Upload job is placed in a priority queue (e.g., Kafka topic: "uploads").
  4. Worker consumes the job, processes chunks (e.g., virus scanning with ClamAV, metadata extraction), stores in S3 with versioning enabled, and updates database metadata.
  5. Upon completion, notify client via WebSocket (e.g., Socket.io) or polling for progress.
- **Scalability**: Auto-scale workers based on queue depth. Use dead-letter queues for failed jobs.
- **Logging**: Integrate with a centralized system like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). Log events at INFO level for progress (e.g., "Upload started for file ID: XYZ") and DEBUG for detailed traces. Use structured logging (JSON format) with correlation IDs for tracing across services (e.g., via OpenTelemetry).
- **Error Handling**: Implement exponential backoff retries (e.g., 3 attempts with 2^x seconds delay) for transient failures (e.g., network issues). Circuit breakers (e.g., Resilience4j) prevent cascading failures. On irrecoverable errors (e.g., invalid file), log at ERROR level, notify user via email/SMS, and rollback partial uploads.
- **Caching**: Use Redis for temporary session-based caching of upload progress (TTL: 1 hour) to reduce database queries during status checks.

#### Asynchronous Download Configuration
- **Process Flow**:
  1. Client requests download via API, which checks permissions and generates a time-limited signed URL (e.g., S3 pre-signed URL, expires in 10 minutes).
  2. For large or processed files (e.g., transcoded videos), enqueue a preparation job in a queue (e.g., Kafka topic: "downloads").
  3. Worker fetches from storage, applies any transformations (e.g., watermarking), and serves via CDN.
  4. Client downloads directly from CDN for low latency.
- **Scalability**: Leverage CDN edge locations for global distribution. Use S3 Transfer Acceleration for faster transfers.
- **Logging**: Log download initiations and completions with metrics (e.g., file size, duration). Aggregate logs in Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring throughput.
- **Error Handling**: Handle 404s gracefully (e.g., "File not found" response). Use rate limiting (e.g., API Gateway) to prevent abuse. Retries for intermittent CDN failures.
- **Caching**: CDN caches frequently accessed files (e.g., TTL based on access patterns). Redis caches signed URLs to avoid repeated generation.

#### Asynchronous Streaming for Video Previewing
- **Process Flow**:
  1. Client requests preview via API, which verifies access and enqueues a transcoding job if needed (e.g., for non-streamable formats).
  2. Worker uses FFmpeg to convert to HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) or DASH, storing segments in S3.
  3. API returns a manifest URL (e.g., .m3u8 for HLS) served via CDN.
  4. Client streams adaptively using HTML5 video or libraries like Video.js, supporting range requests (HTTP 206 Partial Content).
- **Scalability**: Offload transcoding to serverless (e.g., AWS Lambda) or dedicated GPU workers. Use multi-bitrate encoding for adaptive quality.
- **Logging**: Log streaming sessions (e.g., "Stream started for video ID: ABC, user: XYZ") with metrics like buffer underruns. Integrate with video analytics tools.
- **Error Handling**: Fallback to lower quality on bandwidth issues. Handle codec mismatches by re-transcoding. Log warnings for partial streams.
- **Caching**: CDN caches video segments (e.g., edge caching with TTL: 24 hours). Redis for session state (e.g., last viewed position).

#### Overall System Configurations
- **Security**: Encrypt data at rest (S3 SSE) and in transit (TLS 1.3). Use IAM roles for service access.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards. Alert on high error rates or queue backlogs.
- **Best Practices**: Follow 12-factor app principles. Implement blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates.

### Best Practice Database Design

For a storage system, a relational database like PostgreSQL is recommended for metadata management due to its ACID compliance, strong consistency, and support for complex queries (e.g., hierarchical folders via recursive CTEs). Use NoSQL (e.g., DynamoDB) for high-scale logs if needed, but stick to relational for core data to enforce referential integrity.

#### Key Design Principles
- **Normalization**: Aim for 3NF to minimize redundancy, but denormalize selectively (e.g., store computed paths in folders for faster reads).
- **Indexing**: Add indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., user_id, file_id). Use composite indexes for common filters.
- **Partitioning**: Partition large tables (e.g., files) by date or user_id for scalability.
- **Sharding**: If scale exceeds single instance, shard by user or region.
- **Auditing**: Include created_at, updated_at, and deleted_at (soft deletes) in all tables.
- **Constraints**: Enforce foreign keys, unique constraints (e.g., file paths), and check constraints (e.g., positive sizes).
- **Scalability**: Use read replicas for queries; write to primary. Integrate with ORM like SQLAlchemy for maintainability.
- **Backup**: Automated snapshots with point-in-time recovery.

#### Visualized DB Schema
Below is a textual visualization of the core schema using markdown tables for clarity. This represents primary tables and relationships (e.g., one-to-many denoted by arrows). In a real implementation, use tools like ERD diagrams in Lucidchart or dbdiagram.io for graphical views.

### Functional Requirements for the Storage Management System

As an Expert Business Analyst and Technical Lead, I have reviewed the specified technology stack—Next.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend API, Turborepo with Docker Compose for the monorepo structure, PostgreSQL as the self-hosted database, and self-hosted volumes for storage—and aligned the functional requirements accordingly. These requirements are derived from the system's objective to emulate core functionalities of platforms like Google Drive or OneDrive, incorporating asynchronous upload, download, and streaming as previously outlined. I have categorized them into logical modules for clarity, with detailed descriptions of features, user flows, and workflows where applicable. This ensures comprehensive coverage while facilitating phased implementation.

The requirements focus on essential user interactions, data handling, and system operations, assuming integration with the provided tech stack (e.g., Next.js for client-side rendering and API calls, Express.js for RESTful endpoints, PostgreSQL for metadata persistence, and Docker volumes for file storage). Additional considerations, such as security (e.g., JWT authentication) and error handling, are embedded within relevant flows.

#### 1. User Management
- **User Registration**: Allow new users to create accounts via email and password. Workflow: User submits credentials through a Next.js form; backend validates uniqueness, hashes password, and inserts into PostgreSQL Users table. Send verification email. User flow: Enter details → Submit → Verify email → Redirect to dashboard.
- **User Login/Logout**: Authenticate users with credentials or OAuth (if extended later). Workflow: API endpoint verifies credentials, issues JWT token stored in cookies/local storage. Logout invalidates token. User flow: Enter credentials → Authenticate → Access dashboard; or logout → Redirect to login.
- **Profile Management**: Enable users to update email, password, or preferences. Workflow: Authenticated API call updates Users table with validation. User flow: Navigate to profile → Edit fields → Save changes.
- **Password Recovery**: Support forgot-password functionality. Workflow: User requests reset link via email; backend generates token, updates database, and emails link. User flow: Enter email → Receive link → Reset password.

#### 2. File and Folder Management
- **Folder Creation and Navigation**: Users can create, rename, or delete folders with hierarchical structure. Workflow: API inserts into Folders table, computing path for quick lookups; handle parent-child relationships. User flow: From dashboard → Create folder → Name it → View in tree structure (Next.js UI component).
- **File Upload**: Asynchronous multipart upload with progress tracking. Workflow: Client initiates via API; backend generates signed URL or handles chunks, enqueues job for processing (e.g., metadata extraction), stores in Docker volume, updates Files table. User flow: Select file → Upload → View progress bar → Confirm completion.
- **File Download**: Asynchronous download with resumable support for large files. Workflow: API generates time-limited URL; client downloads directly from storage. User flow: Select file → Download → Handle interruptions via range requests.
- **File/Folder Deletion and Trash**: Soft delete with recovery option. Workflow: Update deleted_at in Files/Folders tables; move to trash view. User flow: Select item → Delete → View in trash → Restore or permanent delete.
- **File Versioning**: Maintain versions on updates. Workflow: Increment version in Files table, store historical blobs in storage. User flow: Upload new version → View history → Revert if needed.
- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search across files and folders. Workflow: Query PostgreSQL with indexes on name/path; integrate with extensions like pg_trgm for efficiency. User flow: Enter query in search bar → Display results with previews.

#### 3. Sharing and Collaboration
- **File/Folder Sharing**: Generate share links with permissions (read/write). Workflow: Insert into Shares table; generate unique link. User flow: Select item → Share → Set permissions and expiry → Copy link.
- **Access Control**: Enforce permissions based on ownership or shares. Workflow: API middleware checks Shares table before operations. User flow: Recipient accesses link → Authenticate if required → View/edit content.
- **Collaboration Notifications**: Notify users of shares or changes. Workflow: Enqueue email/SMS jobs post-share. User flow: Share item → Recipient receives notification → Access shared content.

#### 4. Preview and Streaming
- **File Preview**: Support inline previews for images, documents, and videos. Workflow: For videos, enqueue transcoding to HLS/DASH, store segments. User flow: Select file → Load preview in Next.js player.
- **Video Streaming**: Asynchronous adaptive streaming for previews. Workflow: API returns manifest URL; client streams via range requests. User flow: Play video → Adjust quality based on bandwidth.

#### 5. System Administration and Monitoring
- **User Quotas**: Enforce storage limits per user. Workflow: Check size against quota before uploads; update usage in Users table. User flow: Upload → Alert if quota exceeded.
- **Audit Logging**: Track actions for compliance. Workflow: Insert into Audit Logs table on key events (e.g., upload/download). User flow: Admin views logs (if role-based access added).
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Centralized logging for async operations. Workflow: Integrate with tools like Winston in Express.js; handle retries and notifications.

These requirements represent a minimal viable product (MVP) scope, with potential expansions (e.g., real-time collaboration via WebSockets) deferred until core features are implemented.

### Priority and Schedule Table

To facilitate project planning within the monorepo structure, I have prioritized features based on dependency, business value, and implementation complexity. Priorities are categorized as High (essential for MVP, foundational), Medium (enhances usability post-MVP), and Low (advanced, post-launch). The schedule assumes a phased approach over an estimated 3-6 months for a small team, with sprints of 2 weeks each. This is illustrative and can be adjusted based on resources.
